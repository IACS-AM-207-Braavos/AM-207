    "### Abstract: \n",
    "\n",
    "In their paper, Yunus Saatchi and Andrew Gordon Wilson argue that applying Bayesian framework to general adversarial network (GAN) would help prevent mode collapse and result in a more straightforward and accurate model without feature matching or mini-batch discrimination. Specifically, they tackle GAN through a lens of fully probabilistic inference and marginalize the weights of the generator and discriminator using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis below follows closely in the author's footsteps as we re-create their framework for Bayesian GAN and apply their findings to several examples."

    "Â \n",
    "#### GANs Defined: \n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are contained within a deep neural network architecture where two nets - Discriminator and Generator - battle it out. The discriminator usually takes form of a convolutional network that aims to correctly identify the label given a group of asscociated features. In other words the discriminator estimates p(y|X).  The generator, on the other hand, attempts to predict the features given a label (i.e. p(X|y)).  Thus, the generator learns the distribution of the data and then creates new data, while the disriminator attemps to correctly identify the label authenticity given the true data and the fake data coming from the generator.

    "#### Research Motivation: \n",
    "While GANs have proven themselves to be quite powerful, they do have an Achilles heel. Specifically, instances of mode collapse have been noted when the generator ends up memorizing a handfull of training examples. In addition, the authors of the paper highlight the need for meaningful intervention to ensure stability of the network, that requires feature matching, label smoothing and mini-batch discrimination.  While we are less familiar with this terminology, several papers have been written on this topic by [Radfod, Metz and Chintala](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) as well as [Salimans et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498).  The authors also note that most of the research aimed at fixing these issues has focused on finding a better divergence metric for the GAN model (i.e. using Wasserstein or f-divergences instead of Jensen-Shannon).  Yunus Saatchi and Andrew Gordon Wilson take a different approach and propose a Bayesian route toward a more stable GAN architecture. Specifically, the authors apply stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to marginalize conditional posteriors over the weights of the generator and discriminator (more on this below).\n",
