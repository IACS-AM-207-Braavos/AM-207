    "In their paper, Yunus Saatchi and Andrew Gordon Wilson argue that applying Bayesian framework to general adversarial network (GAN) would help prevent mode collapse and result in a more straightforward and accurate model without feature matching or mini-batch discrimination. Specifically, they tackle GAN through a lens of fully probabilistic inference and marginalize the weights of the generator and discriminator using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis below follows closely in the author's footsteps as we re-create their framework for Bayesian GAN and apply their findings to several examples. "

    "#### GANs Defined: \n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as the name suggests, contain two neural network adversaries - Generator and Discriminator - with one forging new data and the other discerning truth from deception. (Goodfellow et al., 2014b)[1]. The discriminator usually takes the form of a convolutional network that aims to correctly identify a given label (usually an image) given a group of associated features. In other words the discriminator estimates p(y|X).  The generator, on the other hand, attempts to predict the features given a label (i.e. p(X|y)).  Thus, the generator learns the distribution of the data and then creates new data, while the discriminator attempts to correctly identify the label authenticity given the true data and the fake data coming from the generator.

Conversely, $1-D(G(z))$, is the probability that the forged image produced by the generator is fake (recall $z$ is the noise vector). Thus, the better the generator gets at forging the images it feeds to the discriminator the higher the value of $D(G(z))$ and $(1-D(G(z))$ starts to approach zero. The discriminator has the opposite goal as it attempts to minimize $D(G(z))$ down to zero by catching all the forgeries, while maximizing $D(x)$. If it accomplishes this goal, we get a value closest to $0$ (i.e. $log(1)$) for the second half of the expression above.

Traditional GAN challenges include: 1) non-covergence, 2) big imbalance between the performance of $D$ and $G$ leading to overfitting, 3) mode collapse (generator memorizes the data and stops creating varied samples), 4) shrinking gradient when discriminator overpowers generator and as the result the generator stops learning, 5) sensitivity to hyperparameters. The bayesian approach to GANs aims to alleviate the mode collapse issues (more on this in the next section) and make training more stable."

As the generator gets better and better (more and more iterations) at producing forgeries, the discriminator gets better and spotting them. As this iterative process continues, we end up with a set of generated hand written images nearly indistinguishable from the original data set."

    "#### Research Motivation: \n",
    "While GANs have proven themselves to be quite powerful, they suffer from several issues as discussed briefly above. Specifically, instances of mode collapse have been noted when the generator ends up memorizing a handfull of training examples. In addition, the authors of the paper highlight the need for meaningful intervention to ensure stability of the network, such as feature matching, label smoothing and mini-batch discrimination.  While we are less familiar with this terminology, several papers have been written on this topic by [Radfod, Metz and Chintala](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) as well as [Salimans et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498)[2,3].  The authors also note that most of the research aimed at fixing these issues has focused on finding a better divergence metric for the GAN model (i.e. using Wasserstein or f-divergences instead of Jensen-Shannon).  Yunus Saatchi and Andrew Gordon Wilson take a different approach and propose a Bayesian route toward a more stable GAN architecture. Specifically, the authors apply stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to marginalize conditional posteriors over the weights of the generator and discriminator (more on this below). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The bayesian approach makes sense as we think about the stability of the GAN model.  By learning full distributions over the generator and the discriminator network weights, we are going to end up with a much richer distribution and more diverse samples, which should make the GAN model less prone to getting stuck in one mode with a handful of memorized images, or be too sensitive to imbalances in the data set.\n",

    "In order to marginalize the posteriors both for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning procedures over $\\theta_d$ and $\\theta_g$, the authors deploy the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) approach. They state three key reasons for this choice: 1) SGHMC is analogous to SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) that has proven to work well with GANs, 2) it allows the authors to import parameters such as learning rate, momentum, etc. from SGD to SGHMC, 3) SGHMC best supports the author's goal to explore richer, multimodal distributions over $\\theta_g$ (i.e. weights of the generator). They argue that  other alternatives tend to provide unimodal distributions. We will not go into a lot of detail on this topic to prove/disprove the author's contention. However, there is a very detailed paper on the topic of SGHMC by [Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4102)[4]"

    "#### In a nutshell:\n",
    "For the generator $\\theta_g$, we produce $J_g$ samples by first sampling our noise and then running SGHMC to produce our $\\theta_g$ samples by taking the derivatives of log-likelihood w.r.t. $\\theta_g$ weights with our noise samples and discriminator $\\theta_d$. The authors included the term $\\eta$ above that comes from the SGHMC paper by [Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4102) and is shown to have a regularizing effect on the noise in the algorithm.[4]  Once we get our new generator sample we append it to our existing list of generator samples. Then rinse and repeat.  The key difference between the generator and the discriminator $\\theta$'s sampling is that we include $x$ from our 'real' dataset for the discriminator (which is expected given our definition of the discriminator in the previous sections). After running this algorithm iteratively, the authors produce a set of posterior  $\\theta_d$ and $\\theta_g$ samples. They note the need for burnin here as samples tend to get more robust overtime."

    "Overall, the idea of using fully Bayesian probabilistic inference on GANs is very intellectually appealing. And in our experiments, BGAN seems to perform quite strongly while providing a principled method to avoid the pernicious problem of mode collapse found in regular GANs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note the great results in semi-supervised learning (with small $N$) on MNIST and avoidance of mode collapse in the four shapes dataset, without *any* manual tuning! That being said, we would be remiss not to point out the fact that BGAN incurs a much higher computational cost than its maximum-likelihood counterpart. Coupled with the fact that a sufficiently tuned ML-GAN can achieve comparable performance, we don't see the *practical* implication of BGANs at this time. (With the caveat that we did not perform sufficient experimentation to make this conclusion in general, as we did not explore the hyperparameter space under each setting nearly enough).\n",

From an intellectual and scientific standpoint, being able to model multi-modal distributions with GANs is very appealing. And while it is certainly an interesting topic worth exploring further, we believe that more work needs to be done to speed up training before this method will be practically desired over ML-based GANs."
